This example demonstrates an uncommon error in Swift related to shadowing of parameter names within a function. The function `calculateArea` takes `length` and `width` as parameters. However, inside the function, a local variable named `length` is also declared. This shadows the parameter `length`, leading to the local variable being used instead of the passed parameter. This can cause unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult. The solution shows how to avoid this by using distinct variable names.
